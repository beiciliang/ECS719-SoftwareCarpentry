    "\n",
    "To execute a background job, just append an ampersand `&` to the command. For example, use the `ping` command to test the connection between your computer and google in the background, and send the outputs into a file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ping www.google.com > ./tempfile.txt &\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also send an already running foreground job to background as explained below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Press `CTRL`+`Z` which will suspend the current foreground job.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Execute `bg` to make that command to execute in background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same `ping` example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ping www.google.com > ./tempfile.txt\n",
    "[CTRL+Z]\n",
    "[1]+  Stopped                 ping www.google.com > ./tempfile.txt\n",
    "bg\n",
    "[1]+ ping www.google.com > ./tempfile.txt &\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can list out the background jobs with the command `jobs`. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "jobs\n",
    "[1]+  Running                 ping www.google.com > ./tempfile.txt &\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `[ ]` numbers are the job numbers that `bg` (background), `fg` (foreground), and `kill` can use.\n",

    "fg %1\n",

    "This capability of sending jobs to background or foreground it's really handy, but if you are logging on and off all the time it's gets difficult. That's why there is a very powerful application it will take you in a completely new different level. It's call `screen` and is more complex. Please [check this article](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-gnu_screen/index.html) for further reading on `screen`."
