## Index

* [The UNIX Shell](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/beiciliang/ECS719-SoftwareCarpentry/blob/master/Lecture-1-The-UNIX-Shell.ipynb): 
use commands to achieve a goal in a terminal session rather than opening multiple applications

* [Version Control](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/beiciliang/ECS719-SoftwareCarpentry/blob/master/Lecture-2-Version-Control.ipynb): 
keep track of changes in the source code, and make it possible for serveral people to collaboratively work on the same code base simultaneously.

* [Python](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/beiciliang/ECS719-SoftwareCarpentry/blob/master/Lecture-3-Python.ipynb): 
a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language, which has a strong position in scientific computing.

## Requirements

Lectures are presented using [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/index.html), which provides a cell-based environment with great interactivity.
To open these `.ipynb` files and run the cells on your own computer, the following steps are required:

1. Anaconda

The general recommendation is that you use the Anaconda distribution to install the Jupyter Notebook, 
and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science. 

Please follow the instructions to [download](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and [install](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) Anaconda.

3. Git

- For version control, you need to install [git](http://git-scm.com/) and register an account at [Github](https://github.com/).

- After installation, you can then download this respository using `git` by running the command line:
```
git clone https://github.com/beiciliang/ECS719-SoftwareCarpentry.git
```

4. Getting Started With Jupyter Notebooks

- Launch the Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Navigator, or run the following command to open up the application:
```
jupyter notebook
```

- Then you'll see the application opening in the web browser on the following address: http://localhost:8888. 

- Navigate to the ECS719-SoftwareCarpentry folder, open a `.ipynb` file and get started!
