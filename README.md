## Index

==========================

* [The UNIX Shell](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/beiciliang/ECS719-SoftwareCarpentry/blob/master/Lecture-1-The-UNIX-Shell.ipynb): 
use commands to achieve a goal in a terminal session rather than opening multiple applications

* [Version Control](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/beiciliang/ECS719-SoftwareCarpentry/blob/master/Lecture-2-Version-Control.ipynb): 
keep track of changes in the source code, and make it possible for serveral people to collaboratively work on the same code base simultaneously.

* [Python](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/beiciliang/ECS719-SoftwareCarpentry/blob/master/Lecture-3-Python.ipynb): 
a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language, which has a strong position in scientific computing.

## Requirements

==========================

Lectures are presented using [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/index.html), which provides a cell-based environment with great interactivity.
To open these `.ipynb` files and run the cells on your own computer, the following steps are required:

1. Check if you already have Python 2 and pip installed

- Start a terminal session: in **Finder**, open the **Application** -> **Utilities** folder, double-click **Terminal**.

- Enter `python` and press return. If you see a response from a Python interpreter it will include a version number in its initial display.
